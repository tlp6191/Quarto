	 * We are only keeping the states with 4,8,or 12 pieces on the board
	 * as a balance between the work and memory of keeping these sets, and 
	 * the desire to have data to analyze and be able to exit a branch quickly. 	
	 * We can actually keep the result in the same set as the game state itself
	 * by utilizing the fact that the first piece in the upper left corner is 
	 * always 0000. So, to store that player 1 won the game, we start the int
	 * with 10. To store that player 2 won, we store 01. To store a tie, 11.
	 * We are doing this because I'm incredible scared of the amount of memory 
	 * we need to store these things.
