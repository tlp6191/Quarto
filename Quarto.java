	We are only keeping the states with 4,8,or 12 pieces on the board
	as a balance between the work and memory of keeping these sets, and 
	the desire to have data to analyze and be able to exit a branch quickly. 	
	We can actually keep the result in the same set as the game state itself
	by utilizing the fact that the first piece in the upper left corner is 
	always 0000. So, to store that player 1 won the game, we start the int
	with 10. To store that player 2 won, we store 01. To store a tie, 11.
	We are doing this because I'm incredible scared of the amount of memory 
	we need to store these things.
